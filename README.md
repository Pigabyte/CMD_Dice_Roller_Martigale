# CMD_Dice_Roller_Martigale
Easy plug and play, no read-me necessary, prompts are self explanatory. 

A few versions of key functionalities achieved over the development period. (Next in line was going to be Server/Client communication, but never got back to it. Maybe later?)

Also a Design picture of what was projected before I started even coding.
